# TL;DR

```sh
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:failure-driven/test-driven-rails-template.git

# create a rails new project using the template
rails _8.0.2_ new rails8-demo \
    --database sqlite3 \
    --minimal \
    --skip-test \
    --skip-keeps \
    --no-skip-javascript \
    --no-skip-rubocop \
    --no-skip-turbo \
    --javascript importmap \
    --template test-driven-rails-template/template.rb

# run any installs depending on selected options
bin/rails importmap:install
bin/rails stimulus:install:importmap
bin/rails turbo:install:importmap

# manually add
# and fix app/javascript/application.js
yarn add react react-dom

make
make build
make dev
```

## NOTE: rails new minimal

**NOTE:** with `--minimal` flag and `--no-skip-turbo` the gem installs seem to be
skipped

```ruby
# Hotwire's SPA-like page accelerator [https://turbo.hotwired.dev]
gem "turbo-rails"
# Hotwire's modest JavaScript framework [https://stimulus.hotwired.dev]
gem "stimulus-rails"
```

# test-driven-rails-template

A Rails template to bootstrap test driven rails project. The template is in
particular focused on creating some initial example tests to help in setting up
a repo to be used in workshops.

## Usage

Basic useage

```sh
rails _6.0.0_ new signup-demo --database=postgresql --skip-test -m template.rb
# OR
rails _8.0.2_ new rails8-demo \
    --database sqlite3 \
    --minimal \
    --skip-test \
    --skip-keeps \
    -m template.rb
```

Full useage

```sh
# create a new rails project
rails _6.0.0_ new signup-demo --database=postgresql \
    --skip-test -m template.rb

## React JS and esbuild vs importmaps

I attempted to go with importmaps but ran into a dead end to have Rails8 and JSX just work. As such I switched to esbuild

as per
- https://ryanbigg.com/2023/06/rails-7-react-typescript-setup

more background
- looking for a way toh Rails 8 + importmaps + React + JSX ?
    - reading [Creating a Rails app with a React.js frontend using esbuild - Ely Karr](
      https://medium.com/@elykarr/creating-a-rails-app-with-a-react-js-frontend-using-esbuild-40152b5b51a)
      says not really and to use esbuild
    - reading https://learnetto.com/tutorials/how-to-use-react-with-rails - also says no
    - there sounds like there was an old gem (4 years old) according to
      [George Gavrilchik - Ruby on Rails with React on Typescript using importmaps](
      https://dev.to/gavrilarails/ruby-on-rails-with-react-on-typescript-using-importmaps-5082)
      the gem https://github.com/mtgrosser/jass-react-jsx
    - and even DHH has some `htm` stuff he promotes here
      [![
      Alpha preview: Using React with importmaps on Rails 7 - David Heinemeier Hansson
      ](
        http://img.youtube.com/vi/k73LKxim6tw/0.jpg
      )](https://youtu.be/k73LKxim6tw)

- another idea is to creating a seperate app in NextJS like [Rails and Next.js:
  the perfect combination for modern web development (Final part) - Raphael
  Almeida AraÃºjo](
  https://medium.com/@raphox/rails-and-next-js-the-perfect-combination-for-modern-web-development-final-part-a88af492a00)

## TODO

- some ideas for templates
    - https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template
    - BUT the author has moved onto their nextgem
    - https://github.com/mattbrictson/nextgen

- [ ] **feedback**
    - [x] rubocop_cache added to .gitignore
    - [x] how to make it work with javascript
        - [ ] and css processor? css works but we probably want sass
    - [x] rubocop requires enabling
  ```ruby
  # config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!
  ```
       seems like this is out of sync with rails_helper.rb which

       > but this behaviour is considered legacy and will be removed in a future version.

    - [x] `.tool-versions` for ASDF
- [ ] **minimal for BDD Workshop**
    - [x] db/structure.sql
    - [x] page fragments
    - [ ] Basic CSS - scss, basic styles
        - [ ] simple ability to add bulma and/or bootstrap
    - [x] Basic JS
    - [ ] View components for:
        - [x] Action button,
        - [ ] Form field with errors?
        - [ ] React component

- [ ] has an issue with method: :delete and turbo
- [x] annotations
    - [x] controllers `chusaku`
    - [x] models `annotaterb`
- [ ] erb-lint https://github.com/Shopify/erb_lint
    and https://github.com/Shopify/better-html#configuration
    ```sh
    bundle add erb_lint
    bundle exec erb_lint  --lint-all --autocorrect
    # hand generated an .erb_lint.yml file
    # probably need a .better-html.yml as well
    # but had a bunch of issues - need to read the docs more
    ```
- [ ] make it work with `Dockerfile` via `--no-skip-docker`
    ```sh
    docker run --env RAILS_ENV=development -p 3000:3000 $(docker build -q .)
    ```
    above does not "name" the image and the port forward seems to not work
- [ ] rubocop and erblint ? and binstubs?
    ```sh
    def run_rubocop_autocorrections
      run_with_clean_bundler_env "bin/rubocop -A --fail-level A > /dev/null || true"
      run_with_clean_bundler_env "bin/erblint --lint-all -a > /dev/null || true"
    end
    ```
- [ ] example using the pause service and force api error?
    - have added a concern and buttons that change state in demo#show but did
      not manage the test to succeed?
- [ ] deal with `.rubocop.yml` conflict (only rails 7 not rails 8)
- [ ] handle `bundle install` when no internet
- [ ] binstub for bin/dev - rails 7 only? seems ok in rails 8
- [ ] Makefile vs Justfile
- [ ] structure.sql over schema.rb
- [ ] fix if there are old versions of gems installed and it breaks on trying to
      install rspec
- [ ] pass parameters like --database and --skip-test directly in the template.rb
- [ ] add files with some demo tests
- [ ] make some of this setup more configurable
- [ ] add a test build to make sure this template can still create a rails
      project based on various starting versions of Rails, Ruby and Node

### DONE

- [x] rspec binstub
- [x] add capybara setup
- [x] test route
      ```ruby
      if Rails.env.test?
        # a test only route used by spec/features/it_works_spec.rb
        get "test_root", to: "rails/welcome#index", as: "test_root_rails"
      end
      ```
- [x] .rspec `--include rails_helper`
- [x] rubocop -A
- [x] can you populate via it_works_spec.rb via ~~ERB~~ .tt
- [x] see how good a "modify works" - seems OK
- [x] rubocop setup
- [x] make sure all example steps are displayed
    - as per https://github.com/railsware/rspec-example_steps/issues/14
    - is this new in rails 8 again?
